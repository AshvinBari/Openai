# OpenAI Projects

Welcome to the **OpenAI Projects** repository! This repo showcases various implementations and experiments using OpenAI's technologies, such as GPT models, LangChain, and integration with JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Overview

This repository contains different projects and code samples leveraging OpenAI's powerful AI models for a variety of use cases, including:

- üß† **LLM (Large Language Model) integrations** with LangChain
- üí¨ **Chatbot development** using GPT models
- üìù **Prompt engineering** techniques for generating better model outputs
- ‚öôÔ∏è **JavaScript/TypeScript** utilities for seamless integration of LLMs into web applications

## Projects in This Repository

1. **LangChain with JavaScript/TypeScript**:
   - Build intelligent applications that chain LLMs with external APIs and data sources.
   - Custom prompts and workflows for creating interactive AI solutions.

2. **OpenAI GPT Chatbot**:
   - Example of a chatbot built using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.
   - Covers integrating real-time responses and enhancing interactions using prompt chaining.

3. **Fine-tuning GPT models**:
   - Steps for fine-tuning GPT models for specific tasks or industries.
   - Scripts for preparing datasets and training the model.

## Key Features

- **LLM Workflows**: Create workflows that chain multiple model interactions or use external data sources with LangChain.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript Compatibility**: Code written in JavaScript/TypeScript for easy integration into modern web apps.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Techniques to improve LLM responses by crafting better prompts.
- **Custom Pipelines**: Build custom pipelines for your specific AI-driven projects.

## Getting Started
